# Lab 5: An Intro to PGL

The main goal for today is to get some practice using the `pgl.py` library to draw some shapes to the screen. As such, your goal is to draw the scene shown in the lab instructions. I've included the `pgl.py` library here, as well as a rough starter file.

No auto-checks on this one, since it is all visual. Just upload your finished code when you are done!
